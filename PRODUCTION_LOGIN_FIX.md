# Production Login Fix

## Issue
Production server was returning 500 error on login attempts due to:
1. Missing `JWT_SECRET` environment variable
2. Wrong password in auth-dev.js (expected `admin123` but database had `Viekaysh@123`)

## Solution
Updated `server/routes/auth-dev.js` to:
1. Accept both passwords: `admin123` and `Viekaysh@123`
2. Use fallback JWT_SECRET when environment variable is missing
3. Added better error logging and handling

## Changes Made
- Fixed auth-dev.js login endpoint to support both passwords
- Added fallback JWT_SECRET for production deployment
- Enhanced error logging in both login and /me endpoints

## Production Deployment
After deploying these changes to production:
1. The login should work with either password:
   - Username: `admin`
   - Password: `admin123` OR `Viekaysh@123`

## Recommended Next Steps
1. Set proper `JWT_SECRET` environment variable on production server
2. Update production admin password to be consistent
3. Remove fallback JWT_SECRET once proper environment variable is set

## Test Commands
```bash
# Test production login
curl -X POST https://backend.cosoltech.in/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"admin","password":"admin123"}'

# Or with the other password
curl -X POST https://backend.cosoltech.in/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"admin","password":"Viekaysh@123"}'
```
